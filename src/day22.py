# behavior in the Spell fields (except duration). Their ongoing impact is
# handled explicitly inside apply_effects based on the effect name. In the
# original implementation Poison incorrectly applied its 3 damage immediately
# upon casting because its damage value was set in the Spell definition.
# According to the puzzle description, Poison only deals damage at the start
# of each turn while active â€“ not immediately when cast. Likewise Recharge
# only grants mana at the start of turns. Shield's armor bonus is applied at
# the start of each turn while active (which includes the very next boss turn
# right after being cast).
